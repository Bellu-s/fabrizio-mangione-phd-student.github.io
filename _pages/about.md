## About Me
I’m currently pursuing a [https://dottorato.dimes.unical.it/](PhD in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)) at the University of Calabria (Rende, Italy), in the Department of Computer, Modeling, Electronic, and System Engineering (DIMES), under the guidance of **Professor Giancarlo Fortino**, IEEE Fellow and highly cited researcher by Clarivate. 

My current interests focus on cutting-edge innovations in **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Generative AI (GenAI)**, **Internet of Things (IoT)**, and **Edge Intelligence (EI)**.

## My Journey

In 2023, I graduated summa cum laude with a Master’s degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Calabria. My thesis, **An LSTM-based Approach for the Prediction of Vehicle Trajectories in the Smart City Environment**, explored how AI can reshape urban transportation systems. I had the privilege to work under the mentorship of leading experts like **Professors Giancarlo Fortino**, **Noel Crespi**, **Roberto Minerva**, and **Claudio Savaglio**.

During my time as a **visiting student** at Telecom Sud Paris (Paris, France), I delved into AI applications for smart cities, with a special focus on predicting vehicle trajectories to improve traffic management and reduce congestion. This research experience inspired my ongoing work, which has already led to three publications in top-tier international journals and conferences.

## What I’m Passionate About

I’m deeply passionate about addressing the challenges that lie at the intersection of **AI**, **IoT**, and **Edge Intelligence**. My current research tackles some of the most exciting problems in these fields, from **e-Health** and **Smart Transportation** to **Industry 4.0**. 

### GenAI and IoT

I'm particularly interested in pushing the boundaries of **GenAI** by developing innovative models that increase the accuracy, scalability, and contextual awareness of AI systems. These models are designed to revolutionize automation and decision-making processes across various sectors.

In the **IoT** space, my focus is on enhancing the efficiency, security, and interoperability of connected devices. By applying AI-driven solutions, I aim to create real-time, adaptive, self-learning ecosystems that optimize data processing and enhance operational intelligence.

### Digital Twins & AI in Education

I also explore the fascinating world of **Generative Digital Twins**—virtual replicas that predict and simulate the behavior of physical systems. This work opens up new possibilities for dynamic, adaptive solutions in **manufacturing**, **urban planning**, and **healthcare**.

In addition, I’m researching the role of **GenAI** in transforming education. I believe AI has the potential to personalize learning experiences, creating **intelligent tutoring systems** that adapt to the needs of individual students. Through AI-generated content, I aim to reshape how educational resources engage and support learners.

## Education

- **Master’s Degree** in Computer Engineering, summa cum laude (2023) – University of Calabria, Italy.
- **Bachelor’s Degree** in Computer Engineering (2021) – University of Calabria, Italy.

## Study abroad

- **Participant student** in the Generative Modeling Summer School (Gemss) at TU/e, Eindhoven, Netherlands, June 2024.
- **Visiting Student** at Telecom Sud Paris from February to June 2023.

## Memberships

I am a proud **student member of the IEEE Society**, continually engaging with a global network of researchers and innovators to push the frontiers of technology.
