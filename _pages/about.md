**Fabrizio Mangione** is a PhD student in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) at Department of Computer, Modeling, Electronic, and System Engineering (DIMES) at University of Calabria (Rende,Italy), under the supervision of Professor Giancarlo Fortino, IEEE fellow and highly cited researcher by Clarivate.  

His research interest includes **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Generative AI (GenAI)**, **Internet of Things (IoT)**, **Edge Intelligence (EI)**.

He received the Master degree in Computer Engineering summa cum laude in 2023, from the University of Calabria with a master thesis entitled **An lstm-based approach for the prediction of vehicle trajectories in the smart city environment** (Prof. Giancarlo Fortino, Prof Noel Crespi, Prof. Roberto Minerava, Prof. Claudio Savaglio).

**Fabrizio Mangione** was a visiting student at the Telecom Sud Paris (FR) in 2023, under the supervision of Professor Noel Crespi and Professor Roberto Minerva. During his research period abroad, he focused on the application of AI, particularly deep learning models, in the context of smart cities. These studies are further expanded during his PhD program and culminated in 3 scientific papers published in top-level international journals and conference proceedings.

**Fabrizio Mangione** is currently a student member of IEEE society.
