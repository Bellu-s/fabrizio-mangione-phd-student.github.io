    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            I’m currently pursuing a 
            <a href="https://dottorato.dimes.unical.it/">PhD in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)</a>
            at the 
            <a href="https://www.unical.it/">University of Calabria</a> (Rende, Italy), in the 
            <a href="https://dimes.unical.it/">Department of Computer, Modeling, Electronic, and System Engineering (DIMES)</a>, 
            under the guidance of <strong>Professor Giancarlo Fortino</strong>, IEEE Fellow and highly cited researcher by Clarivate.
        </p>
        <p>
            My current interests focus on cutting-edge innovations in 
            <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong>, 
            <strong>Generative AI (GenAI)</strong>, 
            <strong>Internet of Things (IoT)</strong>, and 
            <strong>Edge Intelligence (EI)</strong>.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            In 2023, I graduated summa cum laude with a Master’s degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Calabria. My thesis, 
            <strong>An LSTM-based Approach for the Prediction of Vehicle Trajectories in the Smart City Environment</strong>, explored how AI can reshape urban transportation systems. 
            I had the privilege to work under the mentorship of leading experts like <strong>Professors Giancarlo Fortino</strong>, <strong>Noel Crespi</strong>, <strong>Roberto Minerva</strong>, and <strong>Claudio Savaglio</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            During my time as a <strong>visiting student</strong> at Telecom Sud Paris (Paris, France), I delved into AI applications for smart cities, with a special focus on predicting vehicle trajectories to improve traffic management and reduce congestion. 
            This research experience inspired my ongoing work, which has already led to three publications in top-tier international journals and conferences.

    <h2>What I’m Passionate About</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            I’m deeply passionate about addressing the challenges that lie at the intersection of 
            <strong>AI</strong>, <strong>IoT</strong>, and <strong>Edge Intelligence</strong>. My current research tackles some of the most exciting problems in these fields, from <strong>e-Health</strong> and 
            <strong>Smart Transportation</strong> to <strong>Industry 4.0</strong>.
        </p>

        <h3>GenAI and IoT</h3>
        <p>
            I'm particularly interested in pushing the boundaries of <strong>GenAI</strong> by developing innovative models that increase the accuracy, scalability, and contextual awareness of AI systems. 
            These models are designed to revolutionize automation and decision-making processes across various sectors.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the <strong>IoT</strong> space, my focus is on enhancing the efficiency, security, and interoperability of connected devices. By applying AI-driven solutions, I aim to create real-time, adaptive, self-learning ecosystems that optimize data processing and enhance operational intelligence.
        </p>

        <h3>Digital Twins & AI in Education</h3>
        <p>
            I also explore the fascinating world of <strong>Generative Digital Twins</strong>—virtual replicas that predict and simulate the behavior of physical systems. 
            This work opens up new possibilities for dynamic, adaptive solutions in <strong>manufacturing</strong>, <strong>urban planning</strong>, and <strong>healthcare</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, I’m researching the role of <strong>GenAI</strong> in transforming education. I believe AI has the potential to personalize learning experiences, creating <strong>intelligent tutoring systems</strong> that adapt to the needs of individual students. 
            Through AI-generated content, I aim to reshape how educational resources engage and support learners.
