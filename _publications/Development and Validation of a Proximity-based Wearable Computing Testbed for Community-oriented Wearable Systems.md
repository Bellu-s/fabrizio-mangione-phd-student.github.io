In the rapidly evolving digital technology landscape,
community-oriented wearable computing systems are emerging
as a key tool for enhancing connectivity and interaction within
communal spaces. This paper contributes to this burgeoning
field by presenting the development and implementation of a
proximity-based wearable computing testbed designed to forge
stronger links within communities. The testbed exploits Ultra-Wideband (UWB) position sensors, 9-axis motion sensors, edge nodes, and a centralized server, forming a cohesive network that actively facilitates community interactions and engagements. By employing anchors and targets within the UWB sensors, the system achieves high precision in location and distance measurements, laying the groundwork for various proximity-based applications. Integrating 9-axis motion sensors and advanced edge nodes further underscores the system’s versatility and robustness in wearable and edge computing. This paper delves into an in-depth exploration and evaluation of the proposed system’s architecture, design, and implementation processes. It provides a comprehensive analysis of experimental results and discusses the system’s potential impact on enhancing community networks, along with the future directions this technology could take.
